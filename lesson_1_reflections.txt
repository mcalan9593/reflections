How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a   commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

a= the pros to do manually is that you save all that you want, important thinks or in some cases information that is relevant to you
the cons is to save every 1 hour or 1 week or every time you can change some syntax on yor version, but i rahter this than the versions who automatically saved.
